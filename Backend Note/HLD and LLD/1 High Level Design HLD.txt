1. High-Level Design (HLD): The Big Picture
Real-Life Example: Building a House

What it includes:

Architectural blueprint
Room layout, garden area, parking space, etc.
Materials used (brick, cement, etc.) but not how they'll be assembled.
Design Elements:

Shows how major components (kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms) fit together.
Identifies dependencies (e.g., plumbing for the kitchen and bathroom).
Picture Concept: Imagine a blueprint of a house showing the layout of rooms without any details on the type of bricks or tools needed.

2. Low-Level Design (LLD): The Details
Real-Life Example: Furniture in the Living Room

What it includes:

Details about how each room will be decorated.
Specifications for furniture, materials, and the process to assemble them.
Design Elements:

Details of the construction (e.g., dimensions, types of screws and joints for furniture).
Implementation-level choices (e.g., wiring for smart appliances).
Picture Concept: A zoomed-in image of a furniture assembly manual showing step-by-step instructions on how to build a table.
